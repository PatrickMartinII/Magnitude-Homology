# Magnitude-Homology

 This is altered agemath code provided via Hepworth and Willerton in their paper "Categorifying the magnitude of a graph."
 Changes were made to be able to compute Eulerian magnitude homology and to find the explicit generators of torsion subgroups.

 Uncomment lines 31 and 86 for Eulerian magnitude homology.
 Uncomment lines 32 and 87 for ordianry magnitude homology.

 If a graph contains torsion, the torsion subgroup will appear with a list of generators below the identified subgroup.
 The output will be the torsion subgroups along with a table of the ranks of the homology groups.
